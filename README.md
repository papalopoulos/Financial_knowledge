# Matlab
## MATLAB BASED EXAMPLES
**1. Moving averages BOT (MA BOT):** The main idea is to execute code that, based on the technical indicators of moving averages and RSI, shows buy-sell signals, which can be used to infer future signals if autoregressive models or other modeling assumptions are applied.

**2. Derivatives and monte carlo simulations:** The purpouse of this part is to understand and learn how options can be priced through Black-Scholes and how Value at Risk (VaR) can be applied on option valuation.
Calculations here are made via Monte Carlo.
